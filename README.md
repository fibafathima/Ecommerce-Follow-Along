# Milestone 11 - Display Products Dynamically

## Overview 📌

In this milestone, we made the home page dynamic by fetching product data from MongoDB and displaying it using the **Product Card** component.

## What We Did 🔧

### 1️⃣ Backend - Created an API Endpoint

- We wrote an endpoint `/getProducts` in the backend to fetch all product data from MongoDB.
- The endpoint retrieves product details, including name, description, price, category, and image URLs stored in the database.

### 2️⃣ Storing Product Images

- Images uploaded from the frontend are stored in the `uploads/` folder in the backend.
- Only the image file path is stored in MongoDB.
- We used `multer` for handling file uploads.

### 3️⃣ Frontend - Fetching Data

- We created a function in `ProductCardList` to fetch data from the backend using `fetch("https://ecommerce-zof6.onrender.com/getProducts")`.
- The response is stored in the `products` state using `useState()`.

### 4️⃣ Displaying Products Dynamically

- The fetched product data is mapped and passed to the **Product Card** component.
- The image source is set dynamically using `product.images[0]` (assuming the first image).
- The UI now updates automatically when new products are added to the database.

# Milestone 12: Dynamic Product Display

### Overview

In this milestone, we have successfully implemented the feature to dynamically display products on the frontend based on the stored data in the backend.

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Server-Side Enhancements:**

   - Created a new API endpoint (`/getProducts`) to fetch all products from the database.
   - Used `Product.find()` to retrieve stored product details.
   - Handled errors to ensure smooth API responses.

2. **Client-Side Modifications:**
   - Updated `ProductCardList` component to fetch product data from the backend.
   - Used `useEffect` to make an API call and store the retrieved data in state (`setProducts`).
   - Displayed products dynamically based on the fetched data.

### Code Summary:

#### **Backend (`server/routes/productRoutes.js`)**

```js
const express = require("express");
const {
  createProduct,
  uploadImages,
  getProducts,
} = require("../controllers/productController");
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/createProduct", uploadImages, createProduct);
router.get("/getProducts", getProducts);

module.exports = router;
```

# Milestone 13: Edit Uploaded Products

## Overview

In this milestone, we implemented the **Edit Product** functionality, allowing users to modify previously uploaded products. This involved:

- Handling navigation between the product list and the edit form.

---

## 📌 Learning Goals

By the end of this milestone, you will understand:

- How to create an **update endpoint** in Express.js for modifying database entries.
- How to **pre-fill form fields** with existing data for a seamless editing experience.
- How to **send updated product data** from the frontend to the backend and update MongoDB.

---

## 🏗 Steps Implemented

### 1️⃣ Backend: Create the Update Endpoint

We added an endpoint to **fetch a single product** and another to **update product details** in MongoDB.

#### ✅ **Fetch a Single Product**

```javascript
app.get("/getProduct/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const product = await Product.findById(req.params.id);
    if (!product) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
    }
    res.json(product);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Error fetching product" });
  }
});
```

- Eliminated dependency on `localStorage` and URL params for email access, improving security and maintainability.

# **Milestone 32: Progress Summary**

## **1️⃣ Frontend Setup**

- ✅ **Dispatch Email in Login**: Updated the `Login` page to use `useDispatch` to dispatch the `setEmail` action, storing the user’s email in the Redux global state upon successful login.
- ✅ **Access Email with useSelector**: Modified pages to retrieve the email from the Redux store using `useSelector`:
  - Updated `OrderConfirmation` to replace `searchParams.get("userEmail")` with `useSelector((state) => state.user.email)`, adding a redirect to `/login` if the email is `null`.
  - Ensured `PaymentOptions` and `MyOrders` (previously updated) also use `useSelector` for email access.
- ✅ **Removed Redundant Storage**: Eliminated `localStorage` usage for email in `Login` and replaced it with Redux, retaining `localStorage` for the token.

## **2️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **No Changes**: Continued using existing endpoints (`/login`, `/getCart`, `/getUserByEmail`, `/api/v1/orders/create`) without modifications.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Successfully implemented Redux to manage and access the user’s email across the application, enhancing state consistency.
- Added authentication checks in `OrderConfirmation` to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
- Improved security and maintainability by centralizing email management in Redux.

# **Milestone 33: Progress Summary**

## **1️⃣ Frontend Setup**

- ✅ **Updated Login Page**: Modified `Login.jsx` to remove `localStorage.setItem` for both `userEmail` and `token`, relying on Redux (`setEmail`) and the backend-sent cookie (`authToken`).
- ✅ **No Additional Changes**: Ensured compatibility with the new backend cookie-based authentication.

## **2️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **Installed jsonwebtoken**: Added the `jsonwebtoken` package to the server using NPM.
- ✅ **JWT Token Creation**: Updated `loginUser` in `userController.js` to use `jwt.sign` to create a token with `email` and `_id`, signed with `process.env.JWT_SECRET` or a fallback secret.
- ✅ **Set Expiration Time**: Configured the token with `expiresIn: "1h"` and set `maxAge: 3600000` (1 hour) for the cookie.
- ✅ **Added Cookie to Response**: Implemented `res.cookie` to send the `authToken` with `httpOnly`, `secure` (in production), and `sameSite: "strict"` options for security.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Successfully implemented JWT-based authentication, storing the token securely as a cookie instead of `localStorage`.
- Centralized email management in Redux, removing redundant `localStorage` usage.
- Enhanced security with `httpOnly` cookies to prevent client-side access.

-# **Milestone 34: Cookie-Based Authentication Setup**

## **1️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **Created Authentication Middleware**: Added `authenticateToken` middleware in `server/middleware/auth.js` to validate the `authToken` cookie using `jsonwebtoken`, attaching decoded user data (email, id) to `req.user`.
- ✅ **Updated Login to Set Cookie**: Modified `loginUser` in `userController.js` to set the `authToken` cookie with `httpOnly: true`, `maxAge: 3600000` (1 hour), `secure: false` (local testing), and `sameSite: "none"` to handle cross-site requests.
- ✅ **Protected Routes**: Applied `authenticateToken` middleware to routes like `/api/getCart` (routes/cart.js) and `/api/v1/profile/getProfile` (routes/profile.js) to ensure only authenticated users can access them.
- ✅ **Profile Feature Implementation**: Updated `profileController.js` to use `req.user.id` for fetching or creating profiles, eliminating the need for query parameters in `/getProfile` and `/create` endpoints.
- ✅ **Server Configuration**: Added `cookie-parser` middleware in `server.js` and configured CORS with `credentials: true` to allow cookie transmission.

## **2️⃣ Frontend Setup**

- ✅ **Updated Fetch Requests**: Added `credentials: "include"` to all fetch calls (e.g., in `Login.jsx`, `ProfileComponent.jsx`) to send the `authToken` cookie with requests to protected routes.
- ✅ **Profile Component**: Created `ProfileComponent.jsx` to fetch or create a user profile using `/api/v1/profile/getProfile` and `/create`, displaying profile data (name, email, addresses).
- ✅ **Redux Persistence**: Added `redux-persist` to `store.js` to persist the user's email (`state.user.email`) across page refreshes, ensuring seamless state management.
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Updated `fetchProfile` to handle 401/403 errors by redirecting to the login page if the user is unauthorized.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Successfully implemented cookie-based authentication, securing protected routes with the `authToken` cookie.
- Enhanced user experience by persisting the email in Redux across refreshes using `redux-persist`.
- Demonstrated practical application with a profile feature, allowing users to manage their profiles securely.
- Improved security by using `httpOnly` cookies and middleware-based authentication, preventing unauthorized access.
